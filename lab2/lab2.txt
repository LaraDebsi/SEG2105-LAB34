a) There's certain functionality that's only available for a certain type 
(ex. rotatePoint() returns a cartesian point, so you would have to convert 
it back to polar afterwards).

b) So because the two types are so different, converting from one to the other would result 
in some data lost (3D to 2D and vice versa, cartesian coordinates don't take angles into 
consideration, some details won't be able to transfer over). This would probably be minimal 
for one conversion, but converting back and forth eventually would result in inaccurate data 
(either too general or very specific at the wrong point).

c) Done in PointCPTest.main()
